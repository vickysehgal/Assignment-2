      Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names
    </h2>

    <!-- Write a program that takes a list of books, including their authors and
    publication years as input. The program should then filter out all books
    that were published before 2010 and create a new array with the remaining
    books, but with their author names capitalized. -->
